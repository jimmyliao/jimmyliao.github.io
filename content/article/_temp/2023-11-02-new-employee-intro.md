我是 Jimmy Liao ，很高興重新加入 Appier ，目前在 BotBonnie 擔任 Software Engineer。我之前在 AIQUA 擔任 Backend Engineer 負責有關 UI-Backend，離開之後到 InfuseAI 擔任 Customer Success Engineer ，負責有關 PrimeHub MLOps 產品在客戶 Onboarding 以及 Presales, Training 和客戶支援團隊的建立。之後在微軟的客戶事業成功群擔任 Cloud Solution Architect ，負責有關 Azure 上有關 Data/AI 的客戶顧問案，包括前陣子有關 Azure OpenAI handson workshop 的活動，還有比較知名可以透露的專案，像是台積電內部 ChatGPT，聯發科內部的 Copilot，以及幾家銀行和 SI 廠 internal ChatGPT 等等。

很高興重新加入 Appier 並繼續參與 Enterprise Solution 的 RD 活動，希望能夠在這和老朋友，新朋友一起共事與交流。

### 請將上述句子，翻譯成英文

Hi, I'm Jimmy Liao. I'm glad to rejoin Appier, currently working in BotBonnie. Previously I was a Backend Engineer in AIQUA. 

After leaving, I joined InfuseAI as the first CSE, responsible for MLOps product onboarding and Customer Support team building. Then I joined Microsoft as Azure Cloud Solution Architect, deliver Azure OpenAI hands-on workshops for customer, and involve projects such as TSMC's internal ChatGPT, MediaTek's Copilot, and several banks internal ChatGPT, etc.

One interesting fact you may know more about me is that I'd tried to commuting by running or biking from home to office, and it's about 20km. I'd tried to do it for 3 months.

I'm glad to rejoin Appier and continue to participate in the RD activities of Enterprise Solution. I hope to work and exchange with old friends and new friends here.

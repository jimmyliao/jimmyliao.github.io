Since the beginning of June, I have been thinking about how to plan the personal life record and notes better. This article is a simple explanation of the note system starting from the second half of 2023.

I've tried to integrate the blog system in the past few years, but in the first half of this year, most of the technical experiments (Azure) and sharing of the former company. It seems that I need to re-focus on the personal life so that to examinate current options I have.

1. Personal life record, notes: just put it here
2. Technology/current trend observation: put it on [Substack](https://jimmyliaonet.substack.com/)
3. Quick sharing content (mainly mobile writing): put it on [Montaigne](https://jimmyliao.montaigne.io/)
4. Content shared with friends: http://about.jimmyliao.net/ or DM

** 4. About the slogan:**
The slogan 'There is always a better way' is quoted from Thomas Alva Edison (http://thinkexist.com/quotation/there_is_always_a_better_way/146557.html). I heard it when I were in the college at NCTU IEM (http://www.iem.nctu.edu.tw/intro/super_pages.php?ID=intro1). This inspires me to think more in my work or life.

On 2019 April, I came to join Appier AIQUA as Backend and work with lots of talents. As simple Backend Engineer and in charge of Dashboard frontend's backend components. (Django, REST, MySQL, Mongo, and part of React)
In the leisure time, I completed 2 or 3 full-marathons and has two thousand kilometer running records in 2020.
